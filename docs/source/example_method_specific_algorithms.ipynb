    "\n",
    "The Constraint-Principal-Component-Generalized-Projection-Algorithm (C-PCGPA) exploits the fact that a FROG trace can be obtained through an outer product of the pulse and gate. On one hand, this yields an efficient way to calculate a trace. On the other hand this implies that the reverse is also true. Namely that a nonlinear signal field $S(\\tau, t)$ can be transformed into a rank-one matrix consisting of a pulse and gate pair.  \n",
    "The algorithm applies this to construct an update to the pulse. In a first step a nonlinear signal is calculated and projected onto the measured trace, such that $S'(\\tau, t)$ is obtained. Subsequently, $S'$ is transformed and factorized using the Singular-Value-Decomposition (SVD), where the column and row-vector of the first singular value correspond to the updated pulse (and gate). For the ideal solution all other singular values are zero. This factorization into the principle components provides the algorithm with its name.  \n",
    "Since a full SVD is numerically expensive, the power-method can be used to approximate the principal components and iteratively refine them.  \n",
    "Based on the power method the methodology of algorithm can be reformulated into an operator-formalism. In this reformulation the outer-product form of pulse and gate can be viewed as an operator which acts onto the pulse or gate and update them. This allows for the incorporation of additional constraints.  \n",
