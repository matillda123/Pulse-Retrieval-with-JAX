    "# Overview Methods  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section a brief overview over the background and assumptions of all implemented methods is given.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### General Remarks  \n",
    "Each method is implemented as a `RetrievePulsesMETHOD` class in `pulsedjax.core.base_classes_methods.py`. These classes define how input data is processed and prepared for the retrieval process. Most importantly they define how the nonlinear signal field is calculated.  \n",
    "The final useable retrieval algorithms are implemented as child-classes using multiple inheritence `Algorithm(AlgorithmBASE, RetrievePulsesMETHOD)`.  \n",
    "The retrieval takes place on the provided frequency axis (not angular frequency) of the measured trace. This axis needs to be broad enough to avoid interference of fundamental and SHG/THG signals as well as to include the range of the pulse and gate-pulse spetra if those are provided.  "

    "## FROG  \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency-Resolved-Optical-Gating (FROG) can be understood as a spectrally resolved auto- or cross-correlation measurement. Its nonlinear signal is defined as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$S(\\tau, t) = E(t)\\cdot G(A(\\tau, t))$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E(t)=A(t)$ in the case of an autocorrelation setup and G() refers to the nonlinear effect dependent gate-function. Thus a measurement consists of a pulse $A(t)$ which is shifted over $E(t)$ in the time domain. The spectrum of a nonlinear signal at each delay yields the measurement trace $T(\\tau,\\omega) = |S(\\tau, t)|^2$.  \n",
    "The above description assumes a non-collinear setup. However FROG can be performed collinearly, which yields an interferometric setup. Thus the name i-FROG. In this case te nonlinear signal is defined as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$S(\\tau, t) = (E(t) + A(\\tau, t))\\cdot G(E(t) + A(\\tau, t))$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of cross-correlation setup $\\left(E(t)\\neq A(t)\\right)$, the pulse $A(t)$ is not necessarily known. If it is known it can be provided via `algorithm.get_gate_pulse()`. In addition`cross_correlation=True` has to be specified.  \n",
    "If $A(t)$ is unknown a `cross_correlation=\"doubleblind\"` retrieval can be performed. However in such a case serious ambiguities exist, such that the provision of additional constraints is necessary for most algorithms. The spectra of $E(t)$ and $A(t)$ can be provided as such constraints via `algorithm.use_measured_spectrum()`.  \n",
    "The available algorithms for FROG-retrieval are described in [Overview Algorithms](example_overview_algorithms.ipynb) and [Method Specific Algorithms](example_method_specific_algorithms.ipynb).  \n",
    "For i-FROG the algorithms Vanilla, LSGPA, CPCGPA and PIE are not available, due to the requirements of these algorithms."

    "## Chirp-Scan  \n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to FROG a Chirp-Scan is always assumed to be realized in a collinear setup. It is a single pulse method, such that by definition no cross-correlation and no interferometric version exist. It works by applying an arbitrary (but known) higher order spectral phase to the pulse. For each applied phase the spectrum of a nonlinear process is recorded. Yielding a trace of the form $T(\\theta, \\omega) = |S(\\theta, \\omega)|^2$. The signal field is defined as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$S(\\theta, t) = E(\\theta, t) \\cdot G(E(\\theta, t))$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly the spectral phase is applied via material dispersion. However any known spectral phase (e.g. from a pulse shaper) can be used. In a retrieval the `phase_type` has to be specified, either as `\"material\"` or one of the predefined functions in `pulsedjax.core.phase_matrix_funcs.py`. Alternatively a custom function can be function provided `phase_type = myfunction` as outlined below."
